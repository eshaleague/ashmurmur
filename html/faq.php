			<h2>Why esports?</h2>
			<p>ESHA was founded to try and introduce esports in the academic environment.  As more colleges and universities from across North America are supporting eSports by offering scholarships and varsity level esport teams, the ESHA is taking the next step by providing the ultimate eSports experience to high school students in preparation for these collegiate programs. For example, in early January of 2017, the University of Toronto announced their first eSports related scholarship. Esports is also a great way to develops students’ teamwork and leadership skills. </p>

			<h2>How is ESHA run without violating any school policies, and what activities occur during school clubs?</h2>
			<p>The club meetings that occur once a week are used as a place for students to meet up and stay updated with ESHA news using our website and google drive package. Our leadership team provides slideshows and other resources for club captains to run during their meetings. That being said, no video game playing occurs during school hours, and we strictly monitor activities as we work alongside all school captains.</p>

			<h2>I am a student who wants to start a club at my school. How do I get started?</h2>
			<p>The first step in the setup process is completing a short application form here: Captain’s Registration Form.  From there, the ESHA team will establish a communication with you through social media or email. We will then give you further instructions from there.  Captains also have access to the startup package, from the link above, which will be used throughout the startup process. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<h2>How much time do I need to commit to be a captain?</h2>
			<p>Upon partnering with the ESHA, captains will be given one task every week during the first 3 three weeks for club setup and will continue running their club once a week. That being said, captains only need to commit  less than an hour of time every week for success. Additionally, our support team will work alongside captains every step of the way. </p>

			<h2>What kind of items are in the startup package?</h2>
			<p>The startup package, located and share on Google Drive, contains all the essential items needed to setup a successful high school esports club. This includes: A step by step guide, fill in the blank club proposal, student permission forms, posters, information slideshows, and roster submission forms. The package is broken down into 3 phases, with each phase focused on completing a certain task. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<h2>I want to participate in ESHA, but don’t want to start a club and my high school does not have one. What are my options?</h2>
			<p>Although we have done everything to make setting up a club as easy and flexible as possible, we understand that this leadership opportunity is not for everyone. Because our philosophy follows the collegiate esports mentality, you will not be able to participate if you don’t have a club at your school. Your best option is to refer other students or teachers from your school to sign up as a captain who may be interested. </p>

			<h2>What are the benefits of starting and being a club captain at my high school?</h2>
			<p>Not only will you have full on support from the ESHA, you will also be the official president of your esports club, which gives you full control of the majority of your club’s activities (as long as you do not break any school rules). Furthermore, this leadership opportunity is a  great addition for resumes and university application. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<h2>Why is the ESHA format the way that it is?</h2>
			<p>Following the collegiate esports mentality, we believe that the environments established within the high school clubs are of great value and really drive the ESHA experience One of our core values is being able to balance academics with eSports, which we further promote in our program as a kind of preparation for college eSports scholarships. At ESHA we want to take the next step by providing a collegiate esports program in the high school environment.</p>

			<h2>How will I know people will be interested in the club?</h2>
			<p>From our experience with running seasons in the past, on average high school clubs contain around 30-40 students. As long as you follow our simple procedure using the startup package, you should find enough players, especially students you may not know! </p>

			<h2>How do I join a team?</h2>
			<p>ESHA ESports clubs are setup in a partnership with our organisation. If your local eSports club is partnered with us, simply attend the club meetings and you will be put on a team by your school’s captain.  </p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<h2> Can we get someone who isn’t on our team roster to sub for us?</h2>
			<p>No. Any subs need to be a part of your school club, as well as registered on your team. (A sub for school team A can’t sub for school team B). For more specific substitute rules, look at the section above.</p>

			<h2>Can we have bots if we don’t have enough players show up to the game?</h2>
			<p>No. Your team must forfeit the match and receive loss if not enough players show up during your scheduled start time.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<h2>  How do I join my scheduled games?</h2>
			<p>When your match time approaches on your profile page, a button will activate beside the scheduled game. Clicking this button will put you in an online lobby with your teammates and opponents. Your team manager will need to follow the instructions depending on which game you have registered for (An admin may have to guide you into the specific game server). </p>
